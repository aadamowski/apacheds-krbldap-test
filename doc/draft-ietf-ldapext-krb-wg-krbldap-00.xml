        <abstract><t>This document describes an LDAP extended operation to allow transporting Kerberos messages and their corresponding replies to/from a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) instance embedded in an LDAP server. In user organizations, there exist several client and server setups, where LDAP is deployed alongside Kerberos in a closely integrated manner. In such setups, both LDAP and Kerberos server usually share the same user database. The proposed LDAP extension would provide for radical simplification of such setups, by eliminating the necessity to provide Kerberos and LDAP protocols over separate network transports, listening on different TCP (or, in the case of Kerberos, UDP) ports and embedding the Kerberos Key Distribution Center in the LDAP server process. In addition, such integration opens way for further future simplifications, e.g. enabling LDAP layer to infer user identity information directly from the result of Kerberos message exchange and perform Kerberos-based binds without employing the complex GSSAPI mechanism.</t></abstract>

        <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>None. Security of Kerberos messages exchange isn't based on assumptions about the underlying transport protocol. Currently, UDP and TCP are possible as transport protocols for Kerberos. Because the LDAP protocol is itself transported over TCP, embedding Kerberos messages inside it doesn't remove any guarantees that the TCP protocol provides to plain Kerberos (e.g. ordering of packets).</t>
